# Polling_Paper

This repository contains the Python script appendix used for scraping and cleaning polling and media exposure data for the accompanying paper.

The attached folders include all scripts used to collect and process the data. Alternatively, the compiled Stata files (.dta) and corresponding Stata scripts (.do) generated from these Python scripts are also provided.

The .dta file includes additional variables created within the .do file specifically for the analyses conducted in the paper. The only external data source incorporated into the .dta file is state-level registered voter data, which was merged directly within Stata.

Additionally, the Python scripts output two final CSV files, which were also merged in Stata as part of the data preparation process.
